Level Up Life is a mobile application built with Flutter that transforms self-improvement into a captivating role-playing game. Instead of just ticking off tasks, you'll earn experience points (XP), gain levels, and enhance your character's stats by completing real-life activities. This project is currently in active development.

‚ú® Features
Gamified Progression System
Experience & Leveling: Gain XP for every completed activity. Watch your character level up and become more powerful.
Dynamic XP Curve: The XP required to reach the next level increases dynamically, providing a balanced challenge.
Epic Level-Up Notifications: A custom-animated, sci-fi-themed popup announces your new level and title, complete with sound effects.
Character Ranks: Achieve new titles as you advance through levels, from a "Novice Adventurer" to a "Mythic Sovereign".
Streak System: Build and maintain a daily activity streak to earn consistency XP.
Streak Savers: Earn "Streak Savers" at key level milestones (e.g., every 5 levels after level 20) to protect your hard-earned progress.
Activity & Habit Tracking
Timed Activities:
Strength & Intelligence: Engage in focused training sessions using a dedicated, futuristic timer screen. Start, pause, or cancel activities. XP is awarded only upon successful completion.
Sub-Activity Selection: Choose from a list of specific workouts or mental exercises (e.g., "Warrior's Workout", "Mind Quest").
Health Habits:
Water Intake: Log your daily water consumption with a cooldown to encourage consistent hydration throughout the day.
Dental Hygiene: Track teeth brushing with a cooldown to ensure it's logged appropriately.
Daily Activity Calendar: A comprehensive calendar on the profile screen visually marks every day you've logged an activity. This data is fetched directly from a dedicated Firestore log.
Immersive User Interface
Futuristic Dark Theme: A visually rich UI with animated video backgrounds, neon glows, and a cohesive sci-fi aesthetic.
Custom Animations: Smooth and engaging animations using flutter_animate and custom painters for a dynamic user experience.
Sound Effects: An integrated SoundManager provides auditory feedback for clicks, successes, and level-ups, enhancing user immersion.
Custom Widgets: Features a custom-painted circular timer, a sharp-edged progress bar, and many other unique UI components.
Advanced Player Profile
Gaming-Style Dashboard: The profile screen is designed to look like a character stats page from a modern RPG.
Core Attributes Pentagon: A pentagon chart visually represents your character's core stats (Strength, Intelligence, etc.).
Detailed Activity Log: The profile features an interactive calendar that highlights all your active days, providing a long-term view of your consistency.
Player Vitals: Displays your current level, title, and daily streak count prominently.
Backend & Architecture
Firebase Backend:
Firebase Authentication: Secure email & password-based user sign-up and login.
Cloud Firestore: A scalable NoSQL database used to store all user data, including levels, XP, streaks, and detailed activity logs in a subcollection.
Provider State Management: Leverages the Provider package to manage app state efficiently, separating business logic from the UI.
Clean Project Structure: The code is organized by feature and layer (models, providers, screens, widgets), making it scalable and maintainable.
